## Description

Gives the ability to add employees to a flexible database. You can create departments, roles, managers, set salaries, and add the employees.

## Installation

There is no installation for this. The user will need to run npm i to install the necessary packages.

## Usage

After running npm i to install the packages needed, you will open the integrated terminal within the server.js file. Once that is done you will use the command node server.jsto start the program. After that is finished you can select from the choices to begin adding or viewing departments, employees, roles, etc. Once finished, simply select exit.

## Testing

I have tested the program by using it myself, I have also added a seeds file to test with.

## Contributors

Addtional contributors: Jack Storrs (Instructor) assisted me with understanding why I was getting back the extra stuff that sql stores when trying to update employees.
